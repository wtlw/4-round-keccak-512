This repository contains the source code for the tools utilized in our paper.

Our tool requires the following software:

[Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) to solve our MILP models.

In the code folder, there are three experimental codes:

- **Experiment 1** is about "Consuming two degrees of freedom from the guess value."
- **Experiment 2** is about "Consuming two degrees of freedom from the weak digest value."
- **Experiment 3** is about "Consuming one degree of freedom from the weak digest value."

The .sol files are the experimental results we obtained, and running the code directly can reproduce these results.

Please note that the code is designed to run on Windows, so before running it, make sure to check if all file paths are correct.
